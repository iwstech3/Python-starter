# **Exercise for Students:**

# **Task 1: Modify the To-Do List App with Parameters and Arguments**

# Take the initial To-Do List App code provided and modify it to include functions that take parameters and arguments. 

# 1. **Add Task Function Modification:** Modify the `add_task()` function to take a task as a parameter.
# 2. **Delete Task Function Modification:** Modify the `delete_task()` function to take the task index as a parameter for deletion.
# 3. **Update Task Function Modification:** Modify the `update_task()` function to take the task index and the new task as parameters for updating.
# 4. **View Tasks Function Modification:** Keep the `view_tasks()` function as is.

# After modifying the functions, ensure that you update the main loop to correctly call these functions with the required arguments based on the user's input.

# **Exercise Instructions:**

# Write a Python program that simulates a To-Do List App. Your program should provide the following options:
# - Add a task to the to-do list.
# - Delete a task from the to-do list.
# - Update a task in the to-do list.
# - View all tasks in the to-do list.
# - Exit the program.

# To complete this exercise, modify the provided To-Do List App code by adding parameters and arguments to the functions. Ensure that the functions correctly handle the tasks based on the parameters provided.

# Test your program by adding, deleting, updating, and viewing tasks. Make sure to handle edge cases such as invalid task numbers and empty to-do lists. 

# Feel free to enhance the program further with additional features or improvements based on your understanding.
